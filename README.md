## Demonstration
### Red Hat OpenShift Data Science + Starburst Galaxy:  <br>  Access and Explore your Data

#### Introduction
**Red Hat OpenShift Data Science**, a managed cloud platform for Data Scientists and Developers of intelligent applications, supports the full Machine Learning lifecycle by providing a robust, scalable platform and a flexible, interactive environment for teams to do their work. **Starburst Galaxy**, based on open source Trino (formerly PrestoSQL), is a managed service providing a single point of access to your data without having to move it to a central repository. **Starburst Galaxy** focuses on the first, and often most difficult problem teams face when starting a new project - **The Acquisition and Preparation of Data**. 

This demonstration illustrates how quickly a Data Scientist can access data and pull it into the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Jupyter environment using Starburst Galaxy.
